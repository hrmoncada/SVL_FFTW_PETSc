# SVL_FFTW_PETSc

The Fastest Fourier Transform in the west (FFTW)  http://www.fftw.org/

FFTW-PETSc compute the Fourier transform of a 2D and 3D unit cell device. The SVL code can be executed on a personal computer if PETSC and FFTW are properly installed.

For more detail on the code implementation, please review the chapter my MS and Ph.D. thesis at the following links:
MS-CPS Thesis:  See chapter 3 for more details on the code
PhD-CPS Thesis: See chapter 2 for more details on the code
